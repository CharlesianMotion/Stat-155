## Some useful codes in STAT150 Game Theory at UC Berkeley

Stat155, the game theory at Berkeley is an intriguing course I took in fall 2019. I wrote some samll python programs to save students' time from arduous calculation or they can help student check if their hand-calculated results are correct. 

zero-sum.py is used to get the Value Of The Game in a zero-sum game matrix. 

grundy.py is used to calculate the Sprague-Grundy value of a Nim game.
