# Some useful code in game theory

Stat155, the game theory is a course I took in fall 2019 at Berkeley. I wrote some little python programs to save me from arduous calculation. Makes it easier to check if your result is correct. To calculate the Value Of The Game from a zero-sum game matrix. To calculate the Sprague-Grundy value of a Nim game.
